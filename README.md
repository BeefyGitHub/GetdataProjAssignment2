Getting and Cleaning Data: Project Assignment 2

There is only one script file: ``run_analysis.R''. 

To run the script:

(1) Put the script in the top-level directory of the ``UCI HAR Dataset''.
(2) In R, use setwd() to set working directory to the same directory.
(3) Source the script.
(4) When it completes, it creates a new file ``tidy.txt'' that contains the result.
